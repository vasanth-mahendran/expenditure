# Expenditure

This is the academic project to showcase the Architecture of client,server application with the help of java script. This project is deployed in heroku.Application consumes a REST API which reponds with expenditure details of group of friends who spent a vacation together and represents the data in different model like table,charts,maps etc using open source frameworks and plugins.

## Client Framework - React

I have used React Framework as client framework for my project.Since React provides re-usablity at the highest level.React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

## Server Framework - Node

I have used Node JS with Express as a Server Framework.Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It also provides a way to include static assets to the application with minimal code.

## Things i found hard

I found implementing google maps is difficult, since React dependency for google map is not stable and there were lot of open issues for most of the dependendies for react google maps.

## Things i found easy

I found implementing carousel,table,charts were easy,as dependencies took care of everything. simply adding them with data injected,it works like charm.Since Bootstrap provides rebuilt framework for React, Most of the components are easy to write with Bootstrap.

## Dependencies installed

react-gmaps : For including Google maps
react-chartjs-2 : For including charts
react-bootstrap-table : For including table
react-bootstrap : For including carousel and other bootstrap components
express : wrapper for app
babel : for bundling the javascript into single bundle.js

## Commands used for deployment and starting the application

npm run build - to build the applciation i.e bundling the java script files and installing npm modules
npm run start - to start the applicaiton in the node server
